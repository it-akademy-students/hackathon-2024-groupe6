# Project Title

Security in software development is a major concern in the field of computing. While artificial intelligence has made significant advances, human expertise remains essential. To facilitate this expertise, various static code analysis tools have been developed, offering valuable assistance.

This project aims to make the most of these tools and provide a comprehensive and user-friendly application. To achieve this, we utilize tools such as PHP Security Checker, PHPStan, and Composer Audit.
